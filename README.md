# Salesforce Projects Repository

[![CI Workflow](https://github.com/JordanParra96/Salesforce_Projects/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JordanParra96/Salesforce_Projects/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/JordanParra96/Salesforce_Projects/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/JordanParra96/Salesforce_Projects)

this repository contains the metadata of all the projects made for trailhead, there I will be uploading and validating each one to keep the health of the repository in optimal conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As it is an environment where I do testing, it is highly likely that not everything that is there follows 100% best practices and the latest trends, it is just a guide. üèñÔ∏è
